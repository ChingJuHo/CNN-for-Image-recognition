# CNN-for-Image-recognition
In this exercise, you will construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition
by using the Animals-10 dataset. The original dataset contains about 28K animal images with
medium quality where there are 10 categories/animals. The 10 categories are Dog, Horse,
Elephant, Butterfly, Chicken, Cat, Cow, Sheep, Spider, and Squirrel. Some example images of
10 categories are shown below.

The collected dataset is a subset of the original dataset where the number of images for
training and testing in different categories is listed in the following table. This dataset is
accessible in the link https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10. You should perform preprocessing over the images such as resizing or
cropping by yourself in the implementation.
